      <h2>NBA Career Overview</h2>
      <p>LeBron James, a four-time NBA champion, began with the Cavaliers, dominated with the Heat, returned to win a championship for Cleveland, and now plays for the Lakers.</p>
      <p>Drafted first overall in 2003 by the Cleveland Cavaliers, LeBron quickly became one of the NBA's most dominant forces. His combination of size, skill, and basketball IQ set him apart early in his career.</p>
      <p>He took his talents to South Beach in 2010, joining the Miami Heat and forming a legendary trio with Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh, winning two championships in four seasons.</p>
      <p>LeBron returned to Cleveland in 2014 and led the Cavaliers to their first-ever NBA title in 2016. In 2018, he signed with the Los Angeles Lakers, and in 2020, he delivered them an NBA championship in the NBA bubble season.</p>
      <p>Off the court, LeBron is known for philanthropy, founding the I PROMISE School for at-risk children in Akron, Ohio, and being a powerful voice in athlete activism and business.</p>
